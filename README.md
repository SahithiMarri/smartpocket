# ðŸ§  SmartPocket â€“ Voice-Based Money Management for Teenagers

SmartPocket is a web-based application that empowers teenagers to manage their pocket money using natural voice commands. It blends the power of voice AI with financial literacy, gamification, and a teen-friendly design to build smart money habits from an early age.

## ðŸ’¡ Problem Statement

Teenagers often struggle to manage their pocket money due to a lack of simple and engaging financial tools. Existing apps are either too complex or not designed for young users. There's a growing need for a platform that helps teens track expenses, build saving habits, and learn about money â€” in a way that's intuitive and fun.
